## Play

``m!play [url/search term]``

Add the specified URL to the queue. If supplied song is not a valid YouTube URL it will be searched on YouTube and you will be provided with a list of the top 10 results. You can choose which one you want by sending the corresponding number, and the bot will add that song to the queue.
The first song in the queue will be played, and when it is over it will go to the next song in the queue.
