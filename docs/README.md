Documentation for the Scrap Discord Bot

 **⚠️ Warning: This website is under construction. It is in no way final and contains a fraction of Scrap's functions. ⚠️**
 
## Notice

All commands in these docs will start with s!, m!, or g!.

Currently, only the main prefix is changeable (on the dashboard)
The default is s! and the prefix will be refered to as s! in these docs.

Because these docs are unfinished, you have to run s!help in a discord server where the bot is present for a complete list of commands.

### What is Scrap?

Scrap is a multi-purpose bot that does lots of things. Warns, afk system, music, games, and more.
<br/><br/>

### Our Goal

Our goal is to have a fully functioning discord server with music, reaction roles, moderation and more with only 1 bot: Scrap. We want to simplify discord servers, and get rid of all that lengthy setup time and wondering what bots to add.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
This bot is coded with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) wrapper lib.
