Documentation for the Scrap Discord Bot

## A note to whoever is reviewing this site for scrap.js.org

This is a fraction of the site.

You can review individual readmes, or if the site was up and running (which it is, it just needs your aproval) there would be a sidebar for easy navigation and a search box.

## ⚠️ Warning: This website is under construction. It is in no way final and contains a fraction of Scrap's functions. ⚠️

Because these docs are unfinished, you have to run s!help in a discord server where the bot is present for a complete list of commands.

### What is Scrap?

Scrap is a multi-purpose bot that does lots of things. Warns, afk system, music, games, and more.
<br/><br/>

### Our Goal

Our goal is to have a fully functioning discord server with music, reaction roles, moderation and more with only 1 bot: Scrap. We want to simplify discord servers, and get rid of all that lengthy setup time and wondering what bots to add.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
This bot is coded with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) wrapper lib.
