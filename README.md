This is a fraction of the site. There are multiple .md files in the docs folder that contain most of the actual site.

**What is Scrap?** Scrap is a multi-purpose bot that does lots of things. Warns, afk system, music, games, and more. 

**Goal** Our goal is to have a fully functioning discord server with music, reaction roles, moderation and more with only 1 bot: Scrap. We want to simplify discord servers, and get rid of all that lengthy setup time and wondering what bots to add.


This bot is coded with the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs) wrapper lib.
